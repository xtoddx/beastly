= Beastly

Allow your Radiant to play with Altered Beast forum software.

= How

The migrations in this extension load the tables needed for the Beast
installation.  This is necessary because by default Beast uses db:schema:load
which will alter your migration data.  After the migration you can set up
and use Beast with the same login credentials you already have for Radiant.

= Beast Setup

Check out a copy of Altered Beast.
  * git clone git://github.com/courtnay/altered_beast.git

Install the radiant_authentication plugin
  * script/plugin install git://github.com/rubidine/radiant_authentication.git

Install the acts_as_tree plugin (because Radiant pages act as tree)
  * script/plugin install acts_as_tree

Install the default_order plugin (because Radiant models use it)
  * script/plugin install acts_as_tree

Point config/database.yml to the radiant database.

Run beast, probably on a subdomain (or using a rewrite rule, whatever).
